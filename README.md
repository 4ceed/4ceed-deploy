4CeeD Framework Deployment
====

Collections of deployment scripts for various tools and components that make up the 4CeeD framework.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (1.9.1 or later)
- Kubernetes (1.1 or later)

## Quick start
To quickly test 4CeeD framework, we recommend to use a local setup of Kubernetes using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). To setup a local minikube cluster on your computer, follow [minikube's setup instructions](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/).

To start all services, simply run the following command:
```
./startup.sh
```

To stop all services, run the following command:
```
./shutdown.sh
```

## Setup 4CeeD on a Ubuntu cluster
